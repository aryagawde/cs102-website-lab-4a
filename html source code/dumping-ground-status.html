    <p>

    <img src="../img/navelim map.png" title="Source: nona.net" alt="map">
    <figcaption>
        <cite>nona.net</cite>Map of Navelim and around
    </figcaption>
    </figcaption>Our land waste water dumping site is situated at a distance of
    300 metres from the factory location.
    The waste water is transported to the dumping site via tankers. They are costly and are used for dumping of those
    wastewater only that are to be left on open surface in low lying lands to serve as landfills.
    We tend to deliver wastewater rich in solid waste to these open surface land dumping.
    </p>
    <p>
        The underground dumping site is also situated at the same location. But the waste water is transported by
        pipelines.
        They are released at the required spots underground. The locatioin is so chosen where the land is barren
        and the water content in the soil is somewhat less. Overtime, the fertility and quality of these sites will
        improve
        we shall open cooperative sugar-cane industry on open land and shift entirely to undergrounddumping as then open
        surface dumping would pose a problem.
    </p>
    <h3 id="sea-dumping">Sea Dumping</h3>
    <p>
    <address>Arambol, Goa.</address>Our sea waste water dumping site is situated at a distance of 68 kilometres from the
    factory location.
    The waste water is transported to the dumping site via tankers. They are very costly but we cant find a substitute
    for them.
    Being at a sea beach dumping site, pipelines network wont serve the purpose. The sandy ground is not fit for
    supporting pipelines and so tankers are the last scope.
    </p>

    <p>
        The sea dumping site is also situated far away from the factory location.
        Only the best trated wastewaters are released into the sea. The locatioin is so chosen where the high tides are
        less
        and the water content is somewhat less. Overtime, the area will become worse than the present, as all that goes
        to sea is
        all that will go to the atmosphere and all that would fall to us as rain. To practice sustainable sea waste
        water dumping,
        we urge all the <a href="active-citizen.html">citizens to become aware and reduce the contamination of water at
            the
            primary stage.

    <h3 id="river-dumping">River Dumping</h3>
    <p>
    <address>Sal river, Navelim, Goa.</address>Our river waste water dumping site is situated at a distance of 2.8
    kilometres
    from the factory location.
    The waste water is transported to the dumping site via tankers. They are very costly but we cant find a substitute
    for them.
    Being at a laterite dumping site, pipelines network won't serve the purpose. The sandy ground is not fit for
    supporting pipelines and so tankers are the last scope.
    </p>
    <p>
        The river dumping site is also situated far away from the factory location.
        Only the best trated wastewaters are released into the river. The locatioin is so chosen where the water level
        is less.
        Overtime, the area will become worse than the present, as all that goes to river eventually enters sea, and all
        that
        goes to sea is
        all that will go to the atmosphere and all that would fall to us as rain. To practice sustainable fresh waste
        water dumping,
        we urge all the <a href="active-citizen.html">citizens to become aware and reduce the contamination of water at
            the
            primary stage.
